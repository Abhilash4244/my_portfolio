                            Revenue Oppurtunity, Conversion, Conversion % is shown using simple card visuals. Custom Visual Scroller is used to show company wise conversion percentage.
                            Line and Clustered Column chart is used to show the trend of Revenue Oppurtunity and Conversion over the year.
                            Drill down is enabled for Quartly metrics and Tooltip visual is provided for monthly trend. We can see that there 
                            is an increase in trend of number of estimations over the years and as the number of estimations increase we observe 
                            considerable decrease in conversion percentage.
